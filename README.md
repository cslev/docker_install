# docker_install
Simple set of scripts to install docker

Just the basic scripts to install docker and docker-compose.

It becomes handy on a PC where you don't have remote access first, but don't want to install
desktop envionment either.
Just grab the scripts, install docker, run your docker-compose setups that provides you the 
remove access (somehow ;))
